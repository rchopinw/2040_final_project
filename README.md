3. EDAs.ipynb is the EDA codes for the task.
4. baseline_data_process.py processes the data for the baseline model training.
5. model_baseline.py constructs and evaluates the model performance of the baseline models.
6. model_tri_attention_gru.ipynb is the model "Triple-Attention GRU Networks" we developed.
7. model_bert_based_hybrid_attention_networks.ipynb is the model "BERT-based Hybrid Attention Networks" we applied.
8. tf_rec_save.ipynb includes the data processing codes for generating data for training the Triple-Attention GRU Networks model. (Saved as TensorFlowRecords format.)
9. tf_rec_save_bert_tokenizer.ipynb includes the data processing codes for generating data for training the BERT-based Hybrid Attention Networks. (Saved as TensorFlowRecords format.)
